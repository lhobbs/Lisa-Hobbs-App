     <p>I'm Lisa Hobbs, currently a software developer at Denver Public Schools.  I mostly work on web applications
        that support teachers, principals and parents.  Being part of the school district means I also get the 
        opportunity to work with students which is one of my main passions. I love to work on challenging problems
        and having the opportunity to always learn new things.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Grand Lake, Colorado where I had the mountains as my backyard.  I enjoy many outdoor activities such as
         snowboarding, hiking, camping and boating.</p>
